# React Scoreboard
## Description
Scoreboard recreated from a course from TeamTreehouse. I recreated this Scoreboard after watching the course and building it as I went along. I referenced the code a couple of times.
## Technologies

- React.js
- JavaScript

## Issues

1. React.js seems like a complicate view library. I was at lost a couple of times during the course. I had trouble understanding "this". But with practice and additional reading (YDKJS) it is more clear now.

## Next Steps
React.js is an exciting new technology for me. I plan on studying OOJS to more depth and do a couple of React tutorials so I can revisit this project with a clearer mind.
